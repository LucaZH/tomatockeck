**Tomatoescheck**

**Description:**

Tomatoescheck is a web application designed to assist in determining the freshness of tomatoes. Using machine learning, the application classifies tomatoes into three categories: fresh, semi-fresh, and rotten.

This project utilizes Flask, a micro web framework for Python, and TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning framework, to provide an easy-to-use interface. Users can simply upload an image of the tomato they wish to classify, and the model will analyze it, providing the freshness classification.

**Features:**

- Easy-to-use web interface.
- Fast and accurate tomato freshness classification.
- TensorFlow model for image classification.
